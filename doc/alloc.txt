== Custom Allocation ==

Like GMP, PBC can be instructed to use custom memory allocation functions.
This must be done before any memory allocation is performed,
usually at the beginning of a program before any other PBC functions have
been called.

Also like GMP, the PBC wrappers around +malloc+
and +realloc+ will print a message on standard error
and terminate program execution if the calls fail.
Replacements for these functions should act similarly.

However, unlike GMP, PBC does not pass the number of bytes previously allocated
along with the pointer in calls to +realloc+ and
+free+.
