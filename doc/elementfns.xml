<title>Element Functions</title>
<para>
Elements of groups, rings and fields are stored in the <type>element_t</type>
data type. Variables of this type
must be initialized before use, and should be cleared after they are no longer
needed.
</para>
<para>
The <function>element_</function> functions must be used with caution.
Just as division by zero does not make sense for integers,
some operations may not make sense for particular elements. For example,
in a ring, one cannot in general invert elements.
</para>
<para>
Another caveat is that many of these functions assume their arguments come
from the same ring, group or field. No implicit type casting is performed.

<title>Initializing Elements</title>
<para>
When an element is initialized it is associated with an algebraic structure,
such as a particular finite field or elliptic curve group.

<section>
<title>Assigning Elements</title>
These functions assign values to elements. When integers are assigned,
they are mapped to algebraic structures canonically if it makes sense
(e.g. rings and fields).

<title>Algebraic Operations</title>
<para>
All <type>element_t</type> arguments to this function must have been
initialized to be from the same algebraic structure.
</para>
<para>
The addition and multiplication functions perform addition and multiplication
operations in rings and fields. In groups, TODO (basically both can be used
to apply the group operation)
