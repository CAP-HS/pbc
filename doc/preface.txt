== Preface ==

This manual describes how to install and use the PBC pairing-based
cryptography library, version 0.4.18.

It is modeled on the GMP manual. GMP is the GNU multiple precision
arithmetic library, and PBC is built on top of GMP. The PBC API
is strongly influenced by the GMP API, so it is appropriate that
this manual imitates the look and feel of the GMP manual.

== Overview ==

The PBC library is a free portable C library designed to make it easy
to implement
pairing-based cryptosystems. It provides an abstract interface to a
cyclic group with a bilinear pairing, and the programmer does not need
to worry about, or even know about elliptic curves.

It is built on top of GMP, another C library which performs arbitrary
precision arithmetic on integers, rationals and floats with strong emphasis on
portability and speed.

== Installing PBC ==

The PBC library needs http://www.swox.com/gmp/[the GMP library].
Multiple ways to install PBC are provided.

GNU Build System (autotools)::
  This build system has been tested and works on Linux and Mac OS X with a
  fink installation.
+
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install
+
By default the library is installed in `/usr/local/lib`.
On some systems, this may not be in the library
path. One way to fix this is to edit `/etc/ld.so.conf` and
run `ldconfig`.

CMake::
  A `CMakeLists.txt` is also provided.
  CMake is a newer tool that I prefer to use during development.
+
  $ cmake .
  $ make

PBC uses some GNU C extensions, notably nested functions.
For efficiency, some of the lower-level PBC code relies on some GMP internals,
which may change in future releases. In that case, the PBC code will also
have to be updated.
