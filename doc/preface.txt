== Preface ==

The PBC library is a free portable C library allowing the rapid prototyping of
pairing-based cryptosystems. It provides an abstract interface to a cyclic
group with a bilinear pairing, insulating the programmer from mathematical
details. Knowledge of elliptic curves is optional.

The PBC library is built on top of the GMP library, and the PBC API is strongly
influenced by the GMP API. Accordingly, this manual tries to imitate the look
and feel of the GMP manual.

== Installing PBC ==

The PBC library needs http://www.swox.com/gmp/[the GMP library].
Multiple ways to install PBC are provided.

GNU Build System (autotools)::
  This build system has been tested and works on Linux and Mac OS X with a
  fink installation.
+
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install
+
By default the library is installed in `/usr/local/lib`.  On some systems, this
may not be in the library path. One way to fix this is to edit
`/etc/ld.so.conf` and run `ldconfig`.

CMake::
  A `CMakeLists.txt` is also provided.
  CMake is a newer tool that I prefer to use during development.
+
  $ cmake .
  $ make

PBC uses some GNU C extensions, notably nested functions.  For efficiency, some
of the lower-level PBC code relies on some GMP internals, which may change in
future releases. In that case, the PBC code will also have to be updated.
