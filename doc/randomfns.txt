== Random Functions ==

The first time PBC is asked to generate a random number,
the library will try to open the file `/dev/urandom` as a
source of random bits. If this fails, PBC falls back to a deterministic
random number generator (which is of course completely useless for
cryptography).

It is possible to change the file used for random bits. Also, explicitly
selecting the deterministic random number generator will
suppress the warning.

On Windows, by default, PBC uses the Microsoft Crypto API to generate random
bits.
