Information on data types internally used by the library.

=== Dynamic Arrays ===

The +darray_t+ data type manages an array of pointers of type +void \*+,
allocating more memory when necessary.

=== Symbol Tables ===

The +symtab_t+ data type manages symbol tables where the keys are strings of
type +char \*+ and the values are pointers of type +void \*+.

At present, they are implemented inefficiently using dynamic arrays, but this
will change if the need arises.
