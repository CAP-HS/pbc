<title>Param Functions</title>
<para>
These functions are mainly used to generate pairing parameters.
There are several types of pairings, which, like vitamins, are
labelled with capital letters roughly in the order of discovery.
Not all known pairing types are implemented in PBC.

<para>
Type A is best when speed is the main concern,
and type D is a good choice when elements should be short,
though type F has even short elements but is unfortunately slower.

<para>
Pairings on type A curves are the fast and ought to be used where the
main concern is efficiency. Typically, r should be about 160 bits long
and q about 512 bits. In this case, elements of groups G1 and G2 take
512 bits to represent.

<para>
The file <filename>param/a.param</filename> contains parameters for a
type A pairing suitable for cryptographic use.

<para>
The <type>a_param_t</type> data type holds parameters for a type A pairing.
