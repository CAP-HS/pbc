== Changes in PBC 0.5.0 ==

The major changes are pairing parameters and pairing initialization.

For pairing initialization, supply a buffer containing pairing parameters
instead of a `FILE *` stream. For example, rather than:

  pairing_init_inp_str(pairing, stdin);

write something like:

  char s[1024];
  size_t count = fread(s, 1, 1024, stdin);
  if (!count) pbc_die("input error");
  if (pairing_init_set_buf(pairing, s, count)) pbc_die("pairing init failed");

For file reads, personally I like to use mmap() which suits
pairing_init_set_buf().

The `pbc_param_t` data type for pairing parameters replaces `a_param_t`, ...,
`g_param_t`. Having the same data type for all pairing parameter types
simplifies the library, though some functions had to be changed slightly.

At last, one can initialize a `pairing_t` from a `pbc_param_t`:

  pairing_t p;
  pbc_param_t par;
  pbc_param_init_a_gen(par, 160, 512);
  pairing_init_pbc_param(p, par);
  pbc_param_clear(par);

=== Minor differences ===

I trimmed the API. The file stream operations are gone. I removed the
fetch_ops_t and tracker_t types. The standard C library already provides
routines for reading from disk to memory; it is unnecessary for PBC to overlap.

I refactored to avoid exposing `symtab_t` and `darray_t`, as well as several
undocumented routines such as `poly_alloc()`. I mostly preserved the headers
that define these functions, but they are no longer included by `pbc.h`.

I replaced the CMake files with `blynn.make`. I use this during development,
though I test the autotools before each release.

To reduce symbol pollution, all API names now start with
`pbc_`, `field_`, `element_` or `pairing_`. There are undocumented functions
that begin with `poly_`, `curve_`, `darray_`, `symtab_`, and `mpc_` which
