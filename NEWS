The PBC pairing-based cryptography library. See COPYING for license.

Changes between PBC version 0.4.0 and 0.3.17

* Signatures and broadcast encryption spun off into new libraries.
* Memory leaks plugged, including two that were relatively low-level
  (and hence serious).
* New debugging facilities: if PBC_DEBUG is defined, during runtime
  PBC will check that elements from different algebraic structures are not
  mixed.
* If a memory allocation fails, PBC prints a message and quits (rather
  than quietly continuing causing unpredictable behaviour). 
* Custom memory allocation.
* All PBC header files given "pbc" prefix.
* Minor fixes.
